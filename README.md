# CS-370-AI-Maze-Agent

### Project Overview
The goal of this project was to implement a deep Q-learning algorithm to find the best possible navigation sequence that results in reaching the treasure cell while maximizing the reward. The situation is that a pirate (aka our agent) has to navigate a map to get a reward. In this implementation, I was able to determine the optimal number of epochs to achieve a 100% win rate. I was given a complete build of a neural network model and a function that determine whether the pirate can win any game at all.

### Connection to Greater CS Community
In essence, a computer scientist uses technology to solve a wide range of problems. We see the roles of computer scientists expand as our technology gets more advanced. They matter because their jobs are to find efficient solutions to real-life issues, whether it be a physical or technological issue. 

As a computer scientist, I approach problems by doing a lot of analysis and planning before implementing any solutions. I like to think through the best way of solving a problem before and do extra research when necessary. The implementation should be pretty simple once I've conducted my research and thought through a plan. 

Many ethical responsibilities come with being a computer scientist. People are trusting computer systems to handle more of their personal information than ever before. Computer scientists must keep that information safe, anonymous, and out of reach from hackers. They also must prevent themselves from being exposed to sensitive information. With the rising interest in AI systems, computer scientists are responsible for ensuring that all systems are regularly managed to correct biases and that the public is aware of what information they are giving up and allow them to deny this access.
